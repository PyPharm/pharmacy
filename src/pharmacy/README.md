own data validation to ensure that results generated by pharmacy are accurate 
and that the correct data was inputted.

## What is it *not*?
*pharmacy* is not a pharmacy management system and does not replace Epic, Meditech, Pioneer or any other pharmacy software.

- Drug data
  - Use fuzzy and exact-matching to align different drug data files. 
  - Pricing
  - Generic Equivalents
  - Usage
  - Shortages and availability
- Patient profiles
  - Demographics
  - Geolocation
- Prescription data
  - Fills
  - Claims
    - Loss analysis
    - Opportunity analysis
- **Modeling**
  - Integrate pharmacy data with TensorFlow
  - Generate large-scale insights
  - Predict the outcomes of new clinical services based on current data
- **Integration**
  - Incorporate data from ordering sites, etc.
